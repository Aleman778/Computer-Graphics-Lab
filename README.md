# Lab work in computer graphics and geometry
There are four labs included.

## Lab 4
Lab 4 is about creating a simple world and representing it in a scene graph. I went for a slightly different approach and instead implemented a data oriented entity-component-system (ECS). But it can be used as a scene graph by adding parent child components and updating their transforms according to the hierarchy. For the world I wanted to design a snowy scene and this is the final scene:

It was also required that you should be a able to update transforms through a GUI so I implemented a simple world editor.

## Lab 3
Lab 3 is about setting up the graphics for preparing from lab4. Here is how the final scene looks like:

## Lab 2
Lab 2 is focused on computation geometry and is about triangulating points. Here is how thte final scene looks like:

## Lab 1
Lab 1 is of course a fractal in this lab I implemented the Koch snowflake. Here is how the final scene looks like:
